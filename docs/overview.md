# Concord Overview

## Application

Any Laravel 5.3+ application can be a Concord compliant application that complies with its rules.
The application defines it's own logic and incorporates Concord compliant modules.

## Modules

Modules are the de-coupled implementations of the business logic and they have to comply with Concord's basic rules in order to be able to cooperate as a unified application.
