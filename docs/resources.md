# Resources

Resources (assets (css, js, images), lang files, etc) belong to boxes and
applications.

Other than their location in the directory structure, Concord has not much to
say about them. Following Laravel conventions seems like a good idea though.

**Resource Folders:**
```
module-src/
    resources/
        |-- assets/
        |-- lang/
        |-- views/
```

Feel free to add new directories in the resources folder as per your needs.
Concord is a guide not a law ;)
