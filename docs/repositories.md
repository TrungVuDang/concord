# Repositories

Since Eloquent is ActiveRecord, it already works as repository, so Concord repositories are just wrapping Eloquent models, but also add the possibility to create specific retrieval methods and query caching.

> Use of [query scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent#query-scopes) is encouraged.
